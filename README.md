# üìå SE Project ‚Äî **Spots** (Interactive Image Sharing UI)

A responsive, accessible image-gallery interface built with **semantic HTML**, **BEM CSS**, and clean **vanilla JavaScript patterns** (for UI behaviors). Designed from a Figma spec and deployed to GitHub Pages.

## üîé Overview

**Spots** is an interactive front-end project from my web-development learning journey. It showcases:

- Responsive layouts across common screen sizes
- Semantic, accessible markup
- Organized CSS using **BEM** methodology
- Clean UI interactions and intuitive navigation

> Goal: deliver a maintainable, mobile-first UI that feels smooth and consistent on phones, tablets, and desktops.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Responsive grid** for cards / images
- **Modal/lightbox** behavior for viewing images (UI pattern)
- **Add / remove card** UI flows (form validation & UX states)
- **Profile section** UI with editable fields (pattern)
- **Keyboard-friendly** interactions & focus styles
- **BEM structure** for clarity and scalability

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** (semantic structure)
- **CSS3** (flexbox/grid, responsive media queries)
- **BEM** (Block‚ÄìElement‚ÄìModifier)
- **GitHub Pages** (deployment)

## üé® Design Source (Figma)

- Figma spec: **[Sprint-3 Project ‚Äî Spots](https://www.figma.com/file/BBNm2bC3lj8QQMHlnqRsga/Sprint-3-Project-%E2%80%94-Spots?type=design&node-id=2%3A60&mode=design&t=afgNFybdorZO6cQo-1)**

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

```
/
‚îú‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ pages/
‚îú‚îÄ blocks/          # BEM blocks (each with its own CSS)
‚îú‚îÄ images/
‚îú‚îÄ scripts/         # (if included for UI behaviors)

```

## üß≠ Getting Started (Local)

No build step needed.

```bash
# 1) Clone
git clone https://github.com/riffey55/se_project_spots.git
cd se_project_spots

# 2) Open in your browser
# (double-click index.html or serve with any static server)
```

> Optional: use a local static server (e.g., VS Code Live Server) for quick reloads.

## üß© Accessibility Notes

- Semantic headings and landmarks
- Sufficient color contrast from spec
- Focus styles visible for keyboard users
- Alt text on images and labels for forms
- Reduced motion friendly (no aggressive animations)

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap / Ideas

- Replace placeholder data with JSON and render cards dynamically
- Persist likes/added cards locally (LocalStorage)
- Add form validation with error states
- Add simple search/filter for cards
- Extract components and migrate to a framework (React) later

## üìö Lessons Learned

- How BEM naming creates predictable, scalable CSS
- Structuring pages for responsiveness from the start
- Turning a Figma spec into a faithful, accessible UI
- Writing READMEs that help recruiters navigate projects quickly
