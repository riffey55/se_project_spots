# 📌 SE Project — **Spots**

_A responsive gallery app featuring accessible modals, reusable components, and dynamic form validation._

---

## 🌸 Overview

The **Spots Project** is an interactive gallery that allows users to edit their profile information and add new image posts dynamically.  
This sprint focused on improving the **modal user experience (UX)** and implementing a **universal form validation system** written in modular JavaScript.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🪷 **Responsive Layout** — Adjusts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
- 💫 **Accessible Modals** — Open and close using:
  - Escape key
  - Overlay click
  - Close button
- 💻 **Reusable JavaScript Functions** — `openModal()` and `closeModal()` manage all modal logic for cleaner, scalable code.
- 🌿 **Dynamic Validation System** — Fully configurable through a single object in `validation.js`.
- 🖼️ **Interactive Gallery Cards** — Like, delete, and preview images in modals.
- 🪞 **Smooth Animations** — Subtle transitions for hover and card reveal effects.
